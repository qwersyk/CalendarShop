# Calendar Shop

This is a concept idea for a site to add additional events to your Google calendar. You can subscribe to newsletters in the calendar for the release of new episodes of series, or for sports matches, and much more. Also, this site is hosted on [hosting](http://calendarshop.pythonanywhere.com/en/Home/), the problem with this idea is that few people use it and therefore no one creates it, thus recursion is obtained:)
